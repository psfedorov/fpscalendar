You may see the demo [right here](http://nukedukem.orgfree.com/fpscalendar/).

Current version is 1.2.4.

Try it, **fpsCalendar**:
  * is easy to use,
  * is lightweight,
  * has a fast year selection,
  * has an eye candy ("fade in" effect, scriptaculous is not needed),
  * doesn't litter in your namespaces (all names start with "fpsCalendar" prefix).
